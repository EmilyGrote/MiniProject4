Just testing git :)
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

Gender IS Binary 
```{r}
db<- dbConnect_scidb(dbname="imdb")
dbGetQuery("Select name, gender 
From name
Where gender=NULL;"
)
```

gender is still binary 
```{r}
dbGetQuery("Select COUNT(DISTINCT gender) From name;")
```

Some examples of correctly listed trans folks: 
Select name, gender
From name
where name= "Lepore, Amanda"

Select name, gender
From name
where name= "Bono, Chaz"

Non-Binary Person listed as Male 

Select name, gender
From name
where name= "Spoon, Rae"
